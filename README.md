# Voronoi-GA
Generate a voronoi diagram in a circle by given amount of points and their corresponding region area sizes.


To-do List:
Bound Infinite Regions (Project vertices at infinity to a Circle/Square) - 
Calculate Area for the Bounded Infinite Regions (Consists of calculating area of convexhull of the points inside the Circle/Square and the 2 intersection points with the cricle. Then it calculates the area of the Circle Segment and adds it to the area of convex hull) - 
Cut regions that have a vertex or multiple vertices outside the Circle/Square, and calculate area for properly for the that cut region -
